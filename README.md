# Parallel-TSP-2-Opt
Parallelized TSP 2-Opt Approximation Algorithm using Java Threads
 
Began by copying sequential java TSP code and test files from https://github.com/jackspyder/2-opt/

Modified sequential code and created a parallelized version with thread execution pool
Intended to experiment with java multithreading for Parallel and Distributed Systems course
